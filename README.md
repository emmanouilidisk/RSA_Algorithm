<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The repository includes a class implementing RSA algorithm, an example showing its use and a script to test it. 
The algorithm was implemented in the Computer Systems Security course of the 9th semester of DUTh.
  
This implementation uses:
- two primes to calculate n    
- extended GCD method to find the private key(d)    
- Miller-Rabin for primality checking  
- key size 2048 (but it can be easily adjusted for any key size)  


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
To get started make sure you have installed all the prerequisites in your computer and then follow the instuctions in the installation section.

### Prerequisites
To compile this implementation of RSA you will need:
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [boost](https://www.boost.org/users/download/) library, which can also be extracted from the 7z included
  - Make sure to include the path of the library in the CMakeLists
- A compiler that supports std11 and threading
  - (This project was tested with [mingw64](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) version 8)

### Installation
To run the example: 
- Open the example folder and type:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
- Add a file named plain.txt with the message you want to encrypt before running the output file.

To run the tests, follow the same procedure.
